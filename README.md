## Description

This module installs and configures Linux Malware Detect (Maldet)

This module has been tested with Maldet verions:
  - 1.4.x
  - 1.5

By default Maldet is installed from source using the Maldet {} type/provider. If you prefer to use a package, simply use the "package_name" parameter to specify the name of your package, and it will use that instead (assuming any necessary repositories have been enabled).

Maldet will setup a cronjob that runs a daily scan on certain paths on the servers home directory depending on what directories it sees as present on a server.

It will also setup an inotify service to watch and scan changed files under certain directories (set to /tmp, /var/tmp, /dev/shm, and /var/fcgi_ipc by default).

Both the cron job and service are managed by the daily_scan and service_ensure parameters, respectively.

## Usage

```
include ::maldet
```
